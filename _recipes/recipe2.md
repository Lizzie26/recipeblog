These Briouate's are a classic dish in Morocco and are the only traditional meal that includes Kefta which is a spiced mince meat and incorpoates it in a sweet and savoury way. Traditionally, this dish is fried. However, this recipe bakes them instead as a healthier method of cooking. They taste so good and fluffy you won’t even know the difference!

*Makes 15 large Briouate*

## Ingredients 

* 450 gr prepared kefta
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, and more for serving
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 3 eggs
* Salt and pepper
* 200 gr filo pastry
* 1 egg yolk
* 1 tablespoon icing sugar
* A handful of roughly chopped mint leaves (optional) 

## Method

Preheat the oven to 180 C (350 F). Warm up a large pan over medium heat and add in ½ tablespoon of butter and leave until melted. Transfer in the kefta and the cinnamon and cook until the meat is brown, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon. About 7 minutes.

Transfer the cooked kefta to a large bowl. If you notice some liquid, drain the kefta of any excess water to prevent the filling from becoming wet.

In the same pan, add in ½ tablespoon of butter over medium heat and leave until melted. Beat the eggs and transfer them to the pan. Use a wooden spoon to gently stir the eggs until scrambled and fully cooked. Stir the scrambled eggs in the large bowl and mix with the kefta. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.

Melt the remaining butter in a pan or in the microwave. Unroll the filo and cut the pastry lengthways into 10 cm large and 30 cm long rectangles. Use a sharp knife to cut the pastry and keep the filo rectangles covered with a damp towel until ready to use to prevent drying out.

On a work surface, place a filo rectangle and brush it with melted butter. Top the corner of the rectangle with 3 tablespoons of kefta and egg mixture and fold to form a triangle, up to the right and left, until a triangle is formed. Repeat until you’ve exhausted all the kefta and egg mixture.

Transfer the triangles on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush with egg yolk and place in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes until golden.

Serve warm over a bed of chopped mint leaves and a very generous sprinkling of icing sugar and ground cinnamon.
